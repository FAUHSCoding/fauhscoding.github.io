      <p id="pmain">To be or not to be. These words by Williiam Shakespeare truly emphasize the nuances of life. Among the nuances that this quote can relate, leadership itself stands out. In order to be a leader you must choose to be a leader. However, you can't choose to be a leader if you don't know how to be a leader. That is why our club exists to teach you how to be a leader. When you think of coding, leadership isn't the first thing that comes to mind. However, leadership is actually a major part of coding because leadership skills are needed in order to collaborate with other people whie working on projects. If you were to join Coding Club, we would teach you how to be a leader. It is your choice to be a coder or not to be a coder. However, you will learn a lot about leadership if you join coding club.<p>
